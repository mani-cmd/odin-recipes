    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Simple and basic Italian bean soup. Great for a quick fix during the week.
      My Italian mother-in-law rattled this one out to me over the phone years
      ago. So glad I wrote it down quick! She doesn't remember telling me. The
      kids love it for a simple and quick dinner
